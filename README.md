# MapTool by Lave#0012
 
## Getting started

Clone the project repository, open a terminal inside the project directory and run `npm i`.

Once the dependencies have been installed you can start the front-end by running:
### `npm run dev`
This will open the application in development mode. You can open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.
Any edits you make to the code will automatically update in the application when you save them.

You can use:
### `npm run build`
To build the application for production. You can use this when you have finished making changes and want to deploy the application.

## Known bugs
- Sometimes all active tooltips shift when removing a marker. Zoom in/out to reset the tooltip placement
